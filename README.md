Journal about learning to code

1/8/18 | Monday 6:05am
This is day 6 of coding at FCC within their new curriculum. Lots to remember! I hope to jot down some notes each day here of things that I've learned.

FreeCodeCamp profile appears to be down. Hopefully my progress is saved. I was just starting to make my way through the flexbox section and nearly completed. Next up are the projects....then the certificate! Getting excited to start working on the projects! I think I've become more confident in my knowledge and ability to find/figure out the answers to my questions since the last time I was working on the projects. So, hopefully, this time should go quicker (at least at first) and be more enjoyable!

Discouraged. It seemed like FCC beta was close to going LIVE. After some investigation on github, it appears there are still 192 issues to work through. While that is hardly any compared to the 11,600+ closed issues that have been tackled, it still seems like the site might not be going LIVE as soon as I'd like. Perhaps this means I need to adjust my action plan. Will think on this.

Starting to get motivated again. Still have a lot to think about. I'm needing to work on another client project tonight so that takes priority. Still managed to complete three challenges in FCC. Will have more time tomorrow to learn - traveling for work and will have down time.
