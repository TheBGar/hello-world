Journal about learning to code

1/8/18 | Monday 6:05am
This is day 6 of coding at FCC within their new curriculum. Lots to remember! I hope to jot down some notes each day here of things that I've learned.

FreeCodeCamp profile appears to be down. Hopefully my progress is saved. I was just starting to make my way through the flexbox section and nearly completed. Next up are the projects....then the certificate! Getting excited to start working on the projects! I think I've become more confident in my knowledge and ability to find/figure out the answers to my questions since the last time I was working on the projects. So, hopefully, this time should go quicker (at least at first) and be more enjoyable!
